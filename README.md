# Generative-Adversarial-Networks-Coursera
The DeepLearning.AI Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Specialization gave a fascinating exposure to image generation with GANs, outlining a path from fundamental ideas to cutting-edge methods in an approachable manner. Additionally, it discusses social aspects such as privacy protection, bias in ML and how to detect it.

I developed a thorough understanding of GANs, and got practical experience with them. Utilized PyTorch to train the model, used it to generate images, and compare it to a range of sophisticated GANs.

In this course, I :
- Learned about GANs and their applications
- Understood the intuition behind the fundamental components of GANs
- Explored and implemented multiple GAN architectures
- Built conditional GANs capable of generating examples from determined categories
